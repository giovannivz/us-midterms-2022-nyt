For the first time, voters will decide whether to amend their state constitutions to protect abortion rights.\n\nCalifornia, Michigan and Vermont will ask voters whether to add explicit protections to bolster abortion access, especially in Michigan, where a ban on the procedure is blocked in court. Kentucky will ask voters whether to reject protections, opening the door to further restrictions. A majority of Kansans opposed a similar measure in August.\n\nMontana’s ballot measure is unlike the others. If approved, it would criminalize health care providers who do not attempt life-saving care when an abortion results in a live birth, a very rare circumstance.","placement":{"id":"abortion_races","type":"page-header"}},{"paragraph":"Six states will vote on ballot measures related to voting and elections. If passed, measures in Michigan and Connecticut would expand early voting and enact other policies aimed at simplifying the voting process. \n\nOn the other hand, measures in Arizona, Nebraska and Ohio would add restrictions to the process through stricter voter ID and citizenship laws. A measure in Nevada would restructure elections into a system of open primaries and ranked-choice general elections.","placement":{"id":"voting_rights","type":"page-header"}},{"paragraph":"Six states will vote on ballot measures that would legalize or decriminalize certain drugs. Most of these would legalize recreational marijuana.
